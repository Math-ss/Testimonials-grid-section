                    " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the boot camp. I've been looking to make
                    a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                    for the free into course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The
                    next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
                    I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

                    " Before joining thebootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure
                    from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                    by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about th programm. The entire
                    curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long
                    for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. I took my learning to
                    the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it 
                    during interviews as an example of my devlopent experience. It certainly helped me land a job
                    as a full-stack devloper after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended. "
